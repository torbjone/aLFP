- Do we aim to exactly reproduce Hu 2009, or just make an equivalent model?
- Change diameters according to Hu?
- Implement Ih Borg-Graham style?

If we can implement one channel Borg-Graham style, all should work (except NaP which has typo?)


If we use normal dynamics it's not immediately clear how to make our model equal to theirs.
Ih from Magee 1998, but Im and INaP are not that simple.
