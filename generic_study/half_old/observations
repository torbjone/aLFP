From white noise input with tau_w = 10, we see:
    - Somatic input and linear increase: All passive (almost no filtering)
    - Somatic input and linear decrease: Regenerative 10 times larger
      than restorative in EC at apic.
    - Somatic input and uniform: In the middle of the ones described above
    - Middle input: Much less differences on EC for all cases.
    - Apic input: Signal travels best for linear decrease,
      but has least effect on EC. Shape on EC from uniform and linear increase
      are rather similar.
