### How do I get set up? ###
In all folders containing .mod files the command "nrnivmodl" (Linux and Mac) must be excuted in a terminal. This assumes
that NEURON (www.neuron.yale.edu) is set up on the system and functioning properly. LFPy must also be installed.
This can be done by pip install, "pip install LFPy", but see

lfpy.github.io/information.html#installing-neuron-with-python

for more information on how to make NEURON and Python work together.

No attempts has been made for this to work at other operating systems than Linux, but we are happy to help people try
get started.
